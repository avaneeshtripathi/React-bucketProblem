ReactJS Challenge
-------------------


As part of this challenge, you are required to build a simple, 100% client side
react component.

Take a look at attached image. There be 2 lists and 2 buttons between the lists.
User should be able to select/multi-select items from either list and move it to the
other list. It should work both ways

Solution should be provided as ready to run, if any configuration is required then
it should be documented.

Solution will be evaluated on the basis of (not necessarily in the order):
- accuracy of the output
- code architecture
- adherence to flux
- code sanity - comments, indentation etc


All the best!
